        <h3>Algorithms- Algebra</h3>
        <blockquote> Numeric linear algebra, sometimes called applied linear algebra, is the study of how 
            matrix operations can be used to create computer algorithms which efficiently and
             accurately provide approximate answers to questions in continuous mathematics. 
             It is a subfield of numerical analysis, and a type of linear algebra. 
             mputers use floating-point arithmetic and cannot exactly represent irrational data, 
             so when a computer algorithm is applied to a matrix of data, it can sometimes increase 
             the difference between a number stored in the computer and the true number that it is an 
             approximation of. Numerical linear algebra uses properties of vectors and matrices to 
             develop computer algorithms that minimize the error introduced by the computer, and is 
             also concerned with ensuring that the algorithm is as efficient as possible.</blockquote>
