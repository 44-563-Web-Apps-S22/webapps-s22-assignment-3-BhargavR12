           <h3>Bison</h3>
           <p>Bison is a mascot for <i> Howard University</i>. Bison are large, even-toed ungulates in the genus Bison within the subfamily <i>Bovinae</i>.       
                Two extant and six extinct species are recognised. Of the six extinct species, 
                five became extinct in the Quaternary extinction event. Bison palaeosinensis evolved
                 in the Early Pleistocene in South Asia, and was the evolutionary ancestor of B. 
                 priscus (steppe bison), which was the ancestor of all other Bison species. </p>
